    <h1>🌱 Week 1: From Zero to Possibility</h1>
    <h2>My First Steps in Software Engineering with Power Learn Project</h2>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
      If someone told me a few months ago that I'd be learning software engineering, I probably would have smiled politely and shrugged it off.
      <br><br>
      Me? In tech? It felt like a distant world reserved for the gifted — not someone like me, with no tech background and a heart rooted in creativity, crochet, and care.
    </p>

    <p>
      But here I am. One week in. Learning. Growing. Thriving.
    </p>

    <p>
      And it’s all thanks to the Power Learn Project, a community that has not only opened the door to the world of software development, but also walked with me through it with kindness, structure, and belief.
    </p>

    <h3>💻 What I’ve Learned This Week</h3>

    <h4>1. Introduction to Software Engineering</h4>
    <p>
      We started by unpacking what software engineering truly is — not just writing code, but solving real-world problems through design, logic, structure, and teamwork.
      I learned that software engineering is a process, not just a product. That really opened my mind.
    </p>

    <h4>2. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h4>
    <p>
      This was an eye-opener! Understanding the steps involved in planning, designing, developing, testing, and deploying software helped me realize how organized and thoughtful tech creation is.
      I even began using the SDLC model to manage my first hackathon project — a personal portfolio website.
      It’s amazing how this model applies to everyday problem-solving too.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Basic Tools and Methodologies</h4>
    <p>
      We explored the tools developers use, such as Git, VS Code, and GitHub.
      I now understand version control (kind of like a crochet pattern for your code!), and the importance of documenting your work and collaborating on projects.
    </p>

    <h4>4. The Importance of Mindset</h4>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most powerful lesson wasn’t technical — it was emotional.
      I learned that the most important thing I need to succeed in tech is a growth mindset.
      Mistakes are allowed. Struggling is part of learning. Asking questions isn’t weakness — it’s wisdom.
    </p>

    <h3>🌍 My Experience with Power Learn Project</h3>
    <p>
      The Power Learn Project is more than a course — it's a community, a support system, a launchpad for African youth to rise in tech.
      From day one, I felt welcomed, seen, and included.
      There is a spirit of Ubuntu — "I am because we are" — in every class session, group chat, and mentor message.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, you're not just a number on a screen. You're a dreamer being equipped to build solutions for your community and beyond.
    </p>

    <p>
      I especially loved the way the mentors broke down complex topics into bite-sized lessons, like you're being taught as a beginner — with patience, humor, and heart.
      As someone who thrives in creative and emotional spaces, this gave me the courage to believe that I do belong in tech.
    </p>

    <h3>🧠 Reflections</h3>
    <p>
      Before joining PLP, I often felt intimidated by code — it looked like a foreign language.
      But now, I see it differently. I see it as a new tool for storytelling, expression, and change.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yes, it’s hard. Yes, it’s unfamiliar. But it’s also deeply rewarding.
      Every time I understand a new concept, it’s like learning a new stitch in crochet — difficult at first, but beautiful once you see the pattern forming.
    </p>

    <h3>📣 To Anyone Thinking of Starting…</h3>
    <p>
      If you’ve ever doubted yourself, if you’ve ever felt too old, too late, or too far from tech to start — I’m here to say: it’s not too late.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are exactly where you need to be to begin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Start small. Stay curious. Let your passion lead. And when you stumble, remember — you’re not alone.
      There’s a whole community ready to support you, just like I found in Power Learn Project.
