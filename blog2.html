    <h1>🧶💻 Crochet & Code: What These Worlds Have in Common</h1>

    <p>When I first began learning how to code, I never imagined it would feel so… familiar.</p>

    <p>I come from a world of yarn and hooks, where silence is filled with the soft rhythm of stitching — loop by loop, knot by knot. Crochet was my escape, my comfort, and eventually, my voice. It was the art form that saved me during one of the most painful seasons of my life  and in many ways, I learnt how to create beauty from brokenness.</p>

    <p>Now, sitting at my desk, staring at lines of Python code, I’m realizing something:</p>

    <h2>🪢 1. Both Start with a Pattern</h2>
    <p>In crochet, every beautiful design starts with a pattern — a plan that guides your hands from chain stitch to final trim. In coding, we call it logic, or algorithms. Both require you to think ahead, follow steps, and trust the process.</p>
    <p>You might mess up a stitch or a syntax. That’s okay. You unravel. You debug. You try again.</p>

    <h2>💡 2. Creativity Within Structure</h2>
    <p>People think coding is just math, and crochet is just crafts. But both are deeply creative.</p>
    <p>Whether I’m choosing a color palette for a granny square blanket or styling a portfolio website in pink and brown — I’m expressing something. Both art forms let me bring softness into structure, emotion into logic.</p>
    <p>They remind me that I can be technical and tender, analytical and artistic — all at once.</p>

    <h2>🧘🏾‍♀️ 3. Flow State & Healing</h2>
    <p>There’s a calm that comes when you’re lost in a crochet piece — the kind that makes time disappear.</p>
    <p>Learning code is harder. It stretches the mind in uncomfortable ways. But then you figure something out — a bug gets fixed, a loop finally works, your website loads — and it feels like joy.</p>
    <p>Crochet taught me patience. Coding is teaching me perseverance. Both are helping me heal and grow into who I’m meant to be.</p>

    <h2>💻🧶 4. My Dream? Merging the Two.</h2>
    <p>I dream of creating a space where girls like me — those who’ve known loss, silence, or struggle — can find their voice through creativity and code.</p>
    <p>Maybe that’s through teaching crochet as therapy.</p>
    <p>Maybe it’s by designing artistic websites for creative women.</p>
    <p>Maybe it’s by building a platform that combines both.</p>
    <p>Whatever it is, I know this: the same hands that stitched yarn in grief are now typing out a future in tech — and it’s just the beginning.</p>
